# TODO.md

This file contains task-specific project work. `CLAUDE.md` contains permanent rules and must be followed for every task.

Detailed implementation history for completed tasks lives in `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`, not here — this file
stays focused on current/active work plus the compact status list below, per `CLAUDE.md`'s own "Discovery
before editing" step 4.

## Completed / frozen project state

The rebuilt Italian website is approved work. Do not reopen, refactor, redesign, or modify completed work unless the active task strictly requires it.

Completed or inactive work:

- Task 1: Italian website remake for `/it/`, main Italian pages, wine category pages, and product pages.
- Task 2: functional `/it/contatti/` backend/contact-form implementation with email, confirmation, captcha, and retained submissions.
- Task 3: paused/inactive visual-parity bug-fix task. Do not work on it unless the user explicitly reactivates it.
- Task 4: completed/inactive Italian News landing page at `/it/news/`. Superseded by Task 9's shared `/news/`.
- Task 5: completed/inactive Italian Dati societari page at `/it/dati-societari/`. Do not modify unless explicitly reactivated.
- Task 6: completed/inactive Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon + real `/it/privacy-policy/` page. Do not modify unless explicitly reactivated. Merged to `main` at commit `94209c1`.
- Task 7: completed/inactive fix for `ShareButtons.astro` URL-encoding (all 6 links, including Stumbleupon)
  and contact-form server-side length validation. Do not modify unless explicitly reactivated. Committed at
  `716b02a`, merged to `main`. Detail: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`.
- Task 8: completed/inactive fix for missing `bodyClass="singular missing-post-thumbnail"` on `chi-siamo`,
  `cantina`, and `contatti`. Do not modify unless explicitly reactivated. Committed at `03a0459`, merged to
  `main`. Detail: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`.
- Task 9: completed/inactive build of `/en/` and `/de/` website trees (mirroring the Italian architecture,
  filled with real live English/German content), a shared language-neutral `/news/` page (with `/it/news/`
  kept as a 301 redirect), and country-based root `/` routing, plus a follow-up fix for missing hero
  captions and broken category-list links on the `/en/`/`/de/` landing pages. Do not modify unless
  explicitly reactivated. Committed at `05d2bb3` (build) and `202972d` (bug fixes), merged and pushed to
  `main`. Detail: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`.
- Task 10: completed/inactive fix for EN/DE contact-page profile description font-size (matched the role
  text; should be smaller) and the homepage wine-type list formatting (was disorganized/unstyled) — both
  traced to Task 9 reusing Italian-specific page-scoped CSS for EN/DE instead of extracting each language's
  own. Do not modify unless explicitly reactivated. Not yet committed. Detail: `IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.md`.

Preserved constraints from completed work:

- The live Italian website at `rigonivittorino.com/it` remains the source of truth for visible layout, typography, images, spacing, animation, navigation, footer, content, and responsive behavior.
- Preserve the approved rebuilt Italian site except where the active task requires a narrow change.
- English (`/en/`) and German (`/de/`) websites, the shared `/news/` page, and root `/` country
  routing are implemented (Task 9, frozen). Do not modify unless explicitly reactivated. Do not
  translate/correct/improve their content, or reopen the frozen Italian pages beyond Task 9's narrow
  language-switcher/shared-News wiring, without explicit reauthorization.
- Do not modify `rigonivittorinoshop.it`, ecommerce systems, cart, checkout, account, products, payments, or external shop behavior.
- Keep existing visible shop links pointing to `rigonivittorinoshop.it`.
- Do not modify Task 2 contact-backend code (`src/pages/api/contact.ts`, `src/lib/rate-limit.ts`,
  `src/lib/email.ts`, `src/lib/turnstile.ts`, the D1 migration); Task 7's narrow authorization to touch
  `src/lib/contact-validation.ts` is complete and frozen along with it.
- `/it/privacy-policy/` and Cloudflare Web Analytics are implemented (Task 6, frozen); do not modify unless
  explicitly reactivated.
- `/it/dati-societari/` (Task 5) is completed/frozen; do not modify it except to reuse its already-finalized company-identity text for reference.
- Do not work on Task 3 visual bugs or further News scope as part of this task.
